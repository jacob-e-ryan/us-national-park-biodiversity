    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an analysis of data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations. In our hypothetical scenario, we're a biodiversity analyst working for the National Park Service, and the National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of species at risk, to maintain the parks' biodiversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a few questions that we want to answer with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "    Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "    Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was sourced from https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/paths/data-science/biodiversity-solution.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: While inspired by real data, the data here is mostly fictional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we decide the scope of this project. We do this through 4 different categories - Project Goals, Data, Analysis and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In our hypothetical scenario, we're a biodiversity analyst working for the National Park Service, and the National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of species at risk, to maintain the parks' biodiversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the introduction, we have a few questions that we want to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "    Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "    Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have access to two csv files. 'observations.csv' relates to the observations of species in park locations, and 'species_info.csv' relates to information about different species. We'll get into more detail about these once the project is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we import any important modules for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy is for numerical manipulation,\n",
    "pandas is for data manipulation,\n",
    "pyplot and seaborn are for plotting data."
